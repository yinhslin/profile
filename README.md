"Numerical Evidence for a Haagerup Conformal Field Theory": https://journals.aps.org/prl/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevLett.128.231603

Summary: Compute the spectrum of a special (Haagerup) quantum spin chain, and examine scale (conformal) invariance in the long chain limit.

Key techniques: (1) Lanczos algorithm for finding the smallest eigenvalues of matrix, (2) Factorization of dense matrix operators into series of sparse matrix operators, (3) Density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) which approximates the eigenvectors by matrix products.
